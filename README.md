# Pain-Detection-using-Facial-Recogntion
This project deals with the use of facial recognition to solve a healthcare related problem: - Pain detection.
The current paradigm in all Indian colleges usually uses biometric systems as a means for Attendance and counting 
issues. We hope to replace this with a more effective, timesaving and less manual process: Facial Recognition. 
We aim to detect the pain in a personâ€™s facial expressions by means of an algorithm which deduces the Pain Index 
Level (PIL) and hence, the degree of emotions a person is going through. This can also be extended to detect and 
display other emotions such as happiness, anger, and so on. 
This can be applied by extending this system to hospitals, where there is a dire need for such innovations and 
applications. This can be used in hospitals as a tool to detect strong emotions like pain and stress for immobile patients, 
hence immediate medical attention can be brought in such instances.
